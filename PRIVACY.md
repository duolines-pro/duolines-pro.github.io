Privacy Policy for DuoLines
Last updated: February 24, 2026

1. Information Collection
DuoLines collects user-provided settings, such as translation language preferences, UI theme choices, and personal API keys/Google Apps Script URLs. This data is stored locally on the user's device using chrome.storage.

We do not store your personal identity, browsing history, or translated content on our servers. All processing happens in the browser or via the user's chosen API endpoint.

4. Third-Party Services
When using the translation feature, selected text is transmitted to Google services. Please refer to Google’s Privacy Policy for more information on how they handle data.

5. Changes to This Policy
